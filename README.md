# FlaskApp
# simple application on Python Flask can be used for finding specific letters in strings.
# it uses MySql database for storing the history of searches. It also has a mechanism for logging in/out
# for using it pls go to the page /login, then to the main page. For viewing logs you must have special rights. If you have it, pls go to /viewlogs

 the app is in design mode and it's functionality would change soon, after I have a good idea of what should it be helpful for :)
